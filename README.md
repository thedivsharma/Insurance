🧠 Insurance Eligibility AI Agent
A production-grade LLM-driven inference pipeline architected for real-time multi-modal ingestion-to-decision workflows, functioning as an autonomous full-stack underwriting agent leveraging hybrid AI-ML paradigms for insurance validation automation.

💡 System Architecture
Client-side asynchronous multipart/form-data upload of heterogeneous medical document images → On-device transformer-based LLM (Gemma-3) semantic parser with token-level contextual embeddings → Downstream Pydantic-based schema validation enforcing strict domain-specific JSON constraints → Custom probabilistic underwriting engine combining rule-based heuristics with inference layers to simulate expert agent decision boundaries → Final eligibility verdict rendered with stateful session management and persisted via normalized relational schema.

⚙️ Technical Stack & Innovations
Ollama + Gemma-3: Edge-native, containerized transformer inference runtime with possible , scalable and pluggable OpenAI API fallback for failover and throughput scaling.

Pydantic: Declarative type-enforced data integrity layer implementing JSON Schema v7 with dynamic model coercion and runtime validation.

Hybrid Underwriting Model: Expert system fused with probabilistic graphical models integrating heterogeneous feature vectors for nuanced insurance claim risk stratification.

Dynamic Module Loading: insurance_claim namespace injected into sys.path at runtime for seamless decoupling and hot-swappable model logic.

Structured Output Enforcement: Leveraging LLM output parsers with strict schema post-processing, eliminating brittle regex and heuristic extraction patterns.

MySQL RDBMS: ACID-compliant transactional persistence of multi-relational entity graphs capturing patient metadata, extracted fields, and inference provenance.

UUID-Driven Ephemeral Storage: Stateless image lifecycle management leveraging GUID-based namespaces to mitigate data leakage and optimize ephemeral compute workloads.

Django 4.2: Synchronous and asynchronous routing orchestration layer handling multi-step request lifecycles with templated UI feedback loops and session state control.
